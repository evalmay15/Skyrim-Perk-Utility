# Project: Ordinator Implementation
Right now we have a fantastic interface to allow new skyrim players to easily customize their characters in game... but we can do better.  The Skyrim modification <i>Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim</i> is a mod that completely overhauls the perk system.  And with an active community, 22862 endorsments, and at over 1,387,000 downloads (as of 1/9/2018), it has come to our attention that we should be extending our utility to these users as well.

#### What is Ordinator?
Ordinator overhauls the perk trees of Skyrim, replacing them with ~400 new perks to improve the depth and fun of building and playing your character. It accomplishes this in a lightweight, compatible and clean fashion.

Here's a screenshot of just a few perk trees we will be implementing:

#### Whats the progress on the project?
